    "# Evaluating the predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will discuss the importance of evaluating predictions and talk about what it means to evaluate an aspirational model. When a model is aspirational (ie telling a hospital how many beds it would need to provide if the ED was meeting its targets), you cannot evaluate it by comparing with observed patterns of admissions during a period where targets were not met. There are ways to evaluate its components, nonetheless and we will talk about those here. \n",
