    "When dividing your data into training, validation and test sets, a random allocation will make your models appear to perform better than they actually would in practice. This is because random splits ignore the temporal nature of healthcare data, where patterns may change over time. A more realistic approach is to use temporal splits, where you train on earlier data and validate/test on later data, mimicking how the model would be deployed in a real-world setting.\n",

    "To use `patientflow` your data should be in snapshot form. I showed how to create this in the last notebook. I defined a series of prediction times, and then sampled finished visit to get snapshots that represent those visits while still in progress. When you follow this method, you may end up with multiple snapshots. Is this OK, for your analysis? You will need to decide whether you include all snapshots from a single visit into a predictive model. These snapshots from the same visit are inherently correlated, which may violate assumptions of many statistical and machine learning methods. \n",

However, bed managers really want predictions for the whole cohort of patients in the ED at a point in time. This is where `patientflow` comes into its own. In the next notebook, I show how to do this. "
